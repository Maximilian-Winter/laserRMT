## model results
This is a collection of pre-scanned laser results for various models. You are encouraged to make a PR adding laser results for model's that aren't already found here, if you scan a different model. We will update this as we use Laser in our Dolphin models.

# how to use
```python laser_scanner.py --json <path to snr-results.json> --top_percent <the top % of dense layers you want to target>```
